3. Troubleshooting Cheatsheet
Symptom	Cause	Fix	Log File(s)
DNS_PROBE_STARTED in browser	No DNS A record	Add host record for SCCM in DNS Manager (WIN-KF07TP9524F.lab.local -> 10.0.0.11)	DNS logs
MP XML loads by IP but not FQDN	DNS issue	Same as above	IIS logs, mpcontrol.log
ccmsetup.exe not recognized	Not in PATH	Run from Z:\Client after mapping share	Command prompt
UNC paths not supported	CMD limitation	Use net use Z: and map drive	Command prompt
User name or password incorrect	Wrong creds for share	Use domain creds: /user:LAB\Administrator	N/A
“Cannot find LAB site” in log	Boundary misconfigured	Add boundary + boundary group, assign to site	LocationServices.log, ClientLocation.log
ConfigMgr Properties shows “Unknown” connection type	Client hasn’t retrieved policies yet	Run Machine Policy Retrieval & Evaluation Cycle	PolicyAgent.log
Failed to resolve SMS_SLP from WINS	Legacy lookup	Safe to ignore	LocationServices.log
Actions tab empty	Client not registered	Fix site assignment / rerun ccmsetup	ConfigMgr control panel
