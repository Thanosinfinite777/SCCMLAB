1. Purpose of WSUS in SCCM

Acts as the update catalog that SCCM’s Software Update Point (SUP) syncs with.

Provides update metadata (titles, descriptions, categories, required files).

SCCM then uses its own agent/policies to decide which clients need which updates.

2. Steps We Did

Installed the WSUS Server Role on EM01.

Pointed WSUS to use the SQL Server instance (not WID).

Chose to only download metadata, not updates (since we wanted “minimum footprint” in the lab).

Integrated WSUS into SCCM by adding the Software Update Point role.

Selected Windows 10/11 and Server 2022 products + English language only.

3. Validation

Checked wsyncmgr.log on EM01 to confirm sync was happening.

Verified SUP role showed as installed and healthy in the SCCM console.

4. Why This Matters in IT Support

Real companies depend on SCCM to patch workstations and servers.

Understanding SUP + WSUS means you can troubleshoot update compliance issues, which is a day-to-day help desk escalation.
